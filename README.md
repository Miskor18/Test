Classes for exam
Hi I have added the class fr exam from you. There are only classes. Projects were Maven based STS projects created by Spring initializer at https://start.spring.io.
The classes is divided as follows:
1) IMDB API:
-Application.java as main class
-Searchfilms.java as main working class
Im trying to find any working IMDB API, there is no much and no official API. I was trying to use Rapidapi and OMDB API. Example is working with OMDB API, but as I found there is no option by api to filter films only by years, you have to add title or search string for name searching. This is caused by many results. So I made app a little searcher, but for best working it will be usefull to use IMDB free full storage dowmload and own searching mechanism.

2)RESTful simple API
-DemoApplication.java
-Client.java
-ClientController.java
-ClientNotFoundException.java
-ClientNotFoundAdvice.java
-ClientStorage.java
-LoadDb.java
This is very simple REST API example using spring, working with 4 main HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. I have defined only few methonds and one exception. There is comment to test working in browser otherwise its working with tool i.e. Postman.
For these examples I use my spring experience and a little bit of googling. So I hope this is enough for you and your demands are fullfilled. Otherwise I am not 100% clear with it but I need to work on my master diploma too because I have deadline in two weeks....
